# Task 4 - Logistic Regression (AI & ML Internship)


 Objective:
The goal of this task was to build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. I used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to classify tumors as malignant or benign.


 Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn


üìÅ Files Included:
- `logistic_regression_binary_classifier.ipynb` ‚Äì My complete code notebook
- `breast_cancer.csv` ‚Äì The dataset I used
- `task 4-4.pdf` ‚Äì Official task instructions (for reference)


What I Did:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Performed data preprocessing and standardization
- Built a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated it using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision and Recall
  - ROC-AUC Curve
  - Threshold tuning
- Explained how the sigmoid function works in the context of classification


 Key Concepts Covered:
- Logistic Regression for binary classification
- Evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
- Sigmoid function
- Threshold tuning and its effect on model performance


Dataset:
- **Name:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
